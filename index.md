# Project E-Scooter Optimization
This project implements a data pipeline that integrates vehicle and environmental data provided by a micro-mobility company in Washington, D.C. The goal of the pipeline is to efficiently ingest, store, load, and transform diverse data sources in order to create a scalable and reliable data platform. This platform serves as the foundation for various business applications aimed at improving fleet operations and decision-making.

As a first application built on top of this platform, a servicing dashboard has been developed. It leverages the processed data to support optimized fleet management, provide operational insights, and enable data-driven actions.
